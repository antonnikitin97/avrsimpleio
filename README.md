 * A wrapper library made for the AVR micrcontroller simplifying intefacing with the avr/io library
 * In making this full awareness is given to the existence of such a library already but it is hoped that any programmer using this
 * will find it a lot easier to work with the GPIO and hence be able to focus more on their programming.
